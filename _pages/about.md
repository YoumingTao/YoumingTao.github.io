<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first year graduate student in [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dongxiao Yu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=hiQxuHYAAAAJ) and [Prof. Xiuzhen Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1yGhH0AAAAJ). I am also a research intern in [PART Lab](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/part) at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), where I was very fortunate to work with [Prof. Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/).

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Taishan (Honors) College](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/).
