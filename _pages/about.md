# About Me

I am a research staff with [Telecommunication Networks (TKN) Group](https://www2.tkn.tu-berlin.de/) at the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.tu.berlin/eecs/), [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. habil. Falko Dressler](https://www2.tkn.tu-berlin.de/team/dressler/). I also hold a position at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), where my advisors are [Prof. Dongxiao Yu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hiQxuHYAAAAJ) and [Prof. Xiuzhen Cheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1yGhH0AAAAJ). In addition, I have a close collaboration with [Prof. Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/), the director of the [PRADA Lab](http://www.pradalab.org/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/).

I obtained my bachelor's degree (with distinction) in Computer Science from the [Taishan (Honors) College](https://www.tsxt.sdu.edu.cn/) at [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2021.

*Opening Positions:* Several research intern positions starting from Spring 2024 are available. Please drop me an email with your CV and transcripts, if you are interested.

# Research Statements

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and information networking. Currently, I am mainly focused on developing trustworthy collaborative machine learning algorithms for edge intelligence. Specifically, my research aims to address the following challenge:

**How can we ensure *data privacy*, *fault tolerance*, *algorithmic stability*, *communication/computation efficiency* and *rapid convergence* during the collaborative machine learning and optimization process, especially for edge scenarios with constrained computation/memory capability, limited communication bandwidth, highly dynamic topology and malicious adversaries?**

Ultimately, my research aims to use theory as a guide for building innovative and impactful solutions for the real world.
